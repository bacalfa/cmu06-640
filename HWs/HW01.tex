\section*{Problem 2}

Read Chapter 1 in textbook. Key concepts:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Schr\"odinger Equation (SE): $H\psi = E\psi$, where $H$ is the Hamiltonian operator and $\psi$ is a set of solutions (eigenstates) of $H$. Each solution $\psi_n$ has an associated eigenvalue $E_n$ that satisfies the equation.
	
	\item When applied to a system characterized by multiple electrons interacting with multiple nuclei, equation (1.1), the $\psi$ in SE is the electronic wave function, which cannot be directly observed, and $E$ is the ground-state energy of the electrons.
	
	\item Important quantity in DFT: electron density, $n(\mathbf{r}) = 2\sum_i \psi_i^*(\mathbf{r})\psi(\mathbf{r})$.
	
	\item First theorem of Hohenberg-Kohn: \emph{The ground-state energy from Schr\"odinger's equation is a unique functional of the electron density}.
	
	\item Second theorem of Hohenberg-Kohn: \emph{The electron density that minimizes the energy of the overall functional is the true electron density corresponding to the full solution of the Schr\"odinger equation}.
	
	\item The energy functional contains the following ``known'' terms: the electron kinetic energies, the Coulomb interactions between the electrons and the nuclei, the Coulomb interactions between pairs of electrons, and the Coulomb interactions between pairs of nuclei. And the ``unknown'' term is the exchange-correlation functional.
	
	\item Kohn-Sham equations have single-electron wave functions as their solutions. Need to be solved self-consistently.
	
	\item Different approximations for the exchange-correlation have been proposed, such as the Local Density Approximation (LDA) and the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA), with two most widely used models for the functional: Perdew-Wang (PW91) and Perdew-Burke-Enrzerhof (PBE).
	
	\item Hartree-Fock (HF) method is a wave-function-based approach to solve the SE.
	
	\item In an HF calculation, we fix the positions of the atomic nuclei and aim to determine the wave function of $N$-interacting electrons.
	
	\item Approximate spin orbitals with (finite) basis set (set of functions) and expansion coefficients.
	
	\item The HF method assumes that the exact, $N$-body wave function of the system can be approximated by a single Slater determinant, in which the $N$-electron wave function is formed by combining one-electron wave functions in a way that satisfies the antisymmetry principle (\textit{i.e.}, electrons are fermions, so the wave function must change sign if two electrons change places with each other).
	
	\item HF method does not correctly describe how electrons influence other electrons. More succinctly, the HF method does not deal with electron correlations.
	
	\item Quantum chemistry approaches that are more sophisticated than the HF method for approximately solving the SE capture some part of the electron correlation energy by improving in some way upon one of the assumptions that were adopted in the HF approach.
	
	\item Methods based on a single reference determinant are formally known as ``post-Hartree-Fock'' methods. These methods include configuration interaction (CI), coupled cluster (CC), M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP), and the quadratic configuration interaction (QCI) approach.
	
	\item M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory is based on adding a small perturbation (the correlation potential) to a zero-order Hamiltonian (the HF Hamiltonian, usually). In the M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory approach, a number is used to indicate the order of the perturbation theory, so MP2 is the second-order theory and so on.
	
	\item Another class of methods uses more than one Slater determinant as the reference wave function. These methods include multiconfigurational self-consistent field (MCSCF), multireference single and double configuration interaction (MRDCI), and $N$-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT) methods.
	
	\item The classification of wave-function-based methods has two distinct components: the level of theory and the basis set. The level of theory defines the approximations that are introduced to describe electron-electron interactions. The second, and equally important, component in classifying wave-function-based methods is the basis set. Using a basis set with more functions allows a more accurate representation of the true solution but also requires more computational effort since the numerical coefficients defining the magnitude of each function's contribution to the net function must be calculated.
\end{itemize}
